# Algorithms
Programs written for my algorithms class (Comp Sci 577) at UW-Madison.  The input for the programs are given in a specific way that is specified by the homework prompts.  If curious about the prompts just ask me and I likely can provide. 

HW 2 - dfs.py: Depth First Search <br/>
HW 3 - sched.py: Optimal Interval Scheduling (greedy)<br/>
HW 4 - furthest.py: Furthest in the Future cache replacement policy (greedy) (doesn't fully work nor optimal) <br/>
HW 5 - inversions.cpp: Divide and Conquer to count the number of inversions in a given array <br/>
HW 6 - inversions.c: Divide and Conquer to count the number of intersections between n lines given a starting and ending point for each line <br/>
HW 7 - WIS.c: Weighted interval scheduling problem solved via Dynamic Programming. <br/>
HW 8 - knap.c: Knapsack problem solved via Dynamic Programming.  O(nW) time. <br/>
HW 9 - FF.c: Ford-Fulkerson network flow algorithm for finding maximum flow of a network in O(mC). <br/>
